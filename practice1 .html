	Wiz Khalifa is one of my all time favourite Hip Hop artist over the last decade. He has released many albums(Carbin Fever, Blacc Hollywood and others) and most of his singles stayed on the billbord charts for weeks and months.</p>

	<h2 style="color:blue;">Wiz Khalifa Hobbies</h2>  

	 <p class="For">For most people when asked about their hobbies, you will hear stuffs like swimming, reading or dancing unlike Wiz Khalifa, smooking weed, rapping, partying and having time with pretty ladies is his thing. You may choose to differ but I tell you what? That is what makes him happy. PERIOD. </p>
